Thereweredecreasingfactorscontributingto114.7billionyenofprofitbeforeincometaxessuchasarecordofgainonsalesof
Regarding the Nintendo Switch business during the first half of this fiscal year (April through September 2022), each title released
this period has sold well, withSplatoon 3getting off to a good start with sales of 7.90 million units, as well asNintendo Switch Sports
at 6.15 million units,Mario Strikers: Battle Leagueat 2.17 million units, andXenoblade Chronicles 3at 1.72 million units sold. In
addition, we saw stable sales in titles released through the end of the previous fiscal years, withMario Kart 8 Deluxeselling 3.07
million units (for cumulative sales of 48.41 million units) andKirby and the Forgotten Landselling 2.61 million units (for cumulative
sales of 5.27 million units). Sales of titles from other software publishers also continued to grow steadily, bringing the total number of
million-seller titles during this period to 15, including titles from these other software publishers. As a result of these factors, total
software sales grew by 1.6% year-on-year to 95.41 million units. On the other hand, hardware units sold decreased by 19.2% year-on-
year to 6.68 million units, due to factors such as a shortage of semiconductor and other component supplies.
Turning to our digital business for the dedicated video game platform, Nintendo Switch downloadable versions of packaged
software sold well, and Nintendo Switch Online sales also increased. In addition, sales of add-on content rose not only for Nintendo
titles, but also for titles from other software publishers, along with the sales of download-only titles, helping push digital sales to
187.8 billion yen, up 30.2% year-on-year.
Royalty income was stable, but income from smart-device content declined, with the result that overall sales in our mobile and IP-
related business totaled 23.5 billion yen, down 7.5% year-on-year.
In total, sales reached 656.9 billion yen, with overseas sales of 498.6 billion yen accounting for 75.9% of that total. Operating profit
came to 220.3 billion yen. With the depreciation of the yen in foreign exchange markets, we recorded foreign exchange gains of 76.4
billion yen, with the result that ordinary profit totaled 322.4 billion yen and profit attributable to owners of parent totaled 230.4 billion
yen.
While there is a gradual improvement in semiconductor and other component supplies and a recovery trend in hardware
manufacturing for Nintendo Switch, taking into consideration production and sales performances thus far, we have modified the
Nintendo Switch hardware sales units forecast for the fiscal year. By continually working to front-load production and selecting
appropriate transportation methods in preparation for the holiday season, we will work to deliver as many consoles as possible to
consumers in every region of the world. As for software, we have the release ofBayonetta 3in October, followed byPokémon Scarlet
andPokémon Violetin November,Fire Emblem Engagein January 2023, andKirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxein February
2023. Other software publishers also plan to release a wide variety of compelling titles, and we will work to invigorate the platform
with this continuous stream of new titles combined with the popularity of existing titles.
We have revised the financial forecast originally published on May 10, 2022. For details, please see the Notice of Full-Year
Financial Forecast Modifications issued today (November 8, 2022).
