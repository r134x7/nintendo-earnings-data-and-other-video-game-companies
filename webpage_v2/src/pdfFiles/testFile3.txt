1. Overview of Operating Results and Others 
(1) Overview of Operating Results for the Period (April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022) 
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the continued spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 
changes in the social situation, and spread of digital technologies, among other factors, affected both Japanese and 
overseas economies and societies, as well as customer lifestyles and preferences. As part of our response against the 
spread of COVID-19, the Bandai Namco Group (“the Group”) has been giving the highest priority to the safety of our 
various stakeholders, including employees and their families and our customers, while implementing measures to 
prevent the spread of infection. We also promoted various measures to adapt to diversification in lifestyles and 
preferences of customers such as by strengthening the sales and marketing that utilize digital strategies. We have also 
been taking advantage of the worldview and unique characteristics of IP (Intellectual Property: meaning characters and 
other intellectual property) to further enhance the “IP axis strategy” that aims to maximize IP value through the provision 
of the optimal products and services at the optimal possible times. The measures also include initiatives to expand 
global development, an initiative to strengthen development in regions and businesses with high growth potential, and 
an initiative to realize the total capabilities of the Group in regions around the world under the ALL BANDAI NAMCO 
concept. In addition, the Company determined that in light of the rapidly changing environment, it was necessary to 
formulate a new strategy for a new era and has postponed the start of the new Mid-term Plan, which was originally 
scheduled to start in April 2021, by one year. We positioned the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 as the period to establish 
a business foundation and organizational structure to promote the strategies of the new Mid-term Plan and promoted 
various initiatives to examine strategies, restructure organizations, and strengthen cooperation among businesses. 
The Groupʼs operating results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 exceeded those of the previous fiscal year 
wherein each business was severely impacted by the temporary closure of retail stores and amusement facilities in many 
regions both in Japan and overseas and the cancellation of events, etc. due to the spread of COVID-19. With regard to 
business operations, the Digital Business and the Toys and Hobby Business enjoyed favorable performance, and the 
Groupʼs wide-ranging business portfolio has produced successful outcomes, including the swift implementation of 
various measures to adapt to the changes in customer lifestyles and preferences in each business. 
Consequently, the Groupʼs consolidated operating results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 were net sales of 
889,270 million yen (year-on-year increase of 20.0%), operating profit of 125,496 million yen (year-on-year increase of 
48.2%), recurring profit of 133,608 million yen (year-on-year increase of 52.5%), and profit attributable to owners of 
parent of 92,752 million yen (year-on-year increase of 89.7%). 
 
Operating results by segment are as follows. 
Effective from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Group changed the classification of its reportable segments. 
Consequently, in the following year-on-year comparisons, the figures for the previous fiscal year have been restated into 
the figures for the classifications after the change. 
 
Digital Business 
As for the Digital Business, home video games enjoyed favorable performance with the strong sales of new home 
video game titles such as ELDEN RING and Tales of ARISE for worldwide distribution, and strong repeat sales of existing 
titles due to ongoing measures targeting users. In addition, in network content, new titles enjoyed favorable debuts and 
the performance of key titles was stable, but the favorable levels seen in the previous fiscal year were not reached. During 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, initial expenses, such as development expenses, increased due to the increase of 
launches of new major titles in comparison to the previous fiscal year. 
As a result, net sales in the Digital Business were 378,173 million yen (year-on-year increase of 11.9%), and segment 
profit was 69,634 million yen (year-on-year increase of 22.6%). 
 
Toys and Hobby Business 
As for the Toys and Hobby Business, products for the mature fan base such as plastic models of the Mobile Suit 
Gundam series, collectible figures, and character lotteries performed favorably due to the successful outcomes 
produced by sales, marketing, etc. that utilize digital strategies and expansion of the Business overseas. In addition, 
product sales have recovered, including for prizes, etc. which were affected by the temporary closure of amusement 
facilities in the previous fiscal year. Moreover, in Japan, long-established IP and new IP toys, as well as trading cards for 
overseas markets, confectionery, capsule toys and other toy related products were popular. 
As a result, net sales in the Toys and Hobby Business were 373,625 million yen (year-on-year increase of 24.2%), and 
segment profit was 52,319 million yen (year-on-year increase of 33.9%).

- 3 - 
Visual and Music Business 
As for the Visual and Music Business, in addition to the sales of IP related visual and music package software, 
including the Mobile Suit Gundam series, the LoveLive! series and The iDOLM@STER series, IP related licensing revenue 
contributed to performance. Furthermore, we proceeded with initiatives for new forms of live events that are suited to 
changes in the business environment, such as by streaming the events and utilizing new technologies, and the number 
of events held increased from the previous fiscal year. 
As a result, net sales in the Visual and Music Business were 53,941 million yen (year-on-year increase of 57.6%), and 
segment profit was 5,698 million yen (year-on-year increase of 267.9%).  
Creation Business 
As for the Creation Business, we produced new video works such as the Mobile Suit Gundam series and the LoveLive! 
series, but the contribution to profits was limited due to the business model of recording initial expenses in advance. 
Although licensing revenue was strong due to increased popularity of Gundam, etc., GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA, which 
disseminates information on IP, was impacted by the spread of COVID-19. 
As a result, net sales in the Creation Business were 37,564 million yen (year-on-year increase of 33.1%), and segment 
profit was 2,830 million yen (year-on-year increase of 3.3%). 
 
Amusement Business 
As for the Amusement Business, despite the impact of the spread of COVID-19, there were signs of recovery with net 
sales of existing amusement facilities in Japan increasing 115.5% compared with the previous fiscal year, and 
amusement facilities in Europe and Asia recovered compared with the previous fiscal year. For the Amusement Business, 
in addition to continuing to improve efficiency, we will aim to strengthen the revenue base by promoting initiatives that 
only the Bandai Namco Group can offer, such as strengthening the use of Group products and services. 
As a result, net sales in the Amusement Business were 82,344 million yen (year-on-year increase of 28.8%), and 
segment profit was 4,051 million yen (segment loss for the previous fiscal year was 8,379 million yen).  
Other Businesses 
Other Businesses consist of companies that conduct businesses such as logistics support and other kinds of 
administration and operational support for each of the Group companies. We have been making efforts to manage such 
operations related to group support in an efficient manner. 
As a result, net sales in the Other Businesses were 27,667 million yen (year-on-year increase of 12.2%), and segment 
profit was 347 million yen (year-on-year decrease of 42.4%). 
 
(2) Overview of Financial Position for the Period 
At the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, total assets stood at 862,650 million yen, an increase of 129,867 
million yen from the end of the previous fiscal year. The main factors were increases of 75,074 million yen in cash and

Total net assets stood at 584,233 million yen, an increase of 72,800 million yen from the end of the previous fiscal 
year. The main factors were an increase of 67,660 million yen in retained earnings mainly due to the recording of 92,752

Looking ahead, the Group expects uncertainty to continue due to changes in the social situation despite anticipating 
that the economy and personal consumption will recover due to the promotion of measures against the spread of COVID-
19 and COVID-19 vaccinations in various regions around the world. 
Under these circumstances, the Group will continue carrying out initiatives to prevent the spread of COVID-19, giving 
the highest priority to the safety of our stakeholders, including employees and their families, and customers. Moreover, 
adapting to escalating competitiveness in global markets and diversification in lifestyles and preferences of customers, 
in line with an IP axis strategy, the Bandai Namco Group will enhance sense of unity and its total capabilities under the 
ALL BANDAI NAMCO concept, while utilizing the characteristics of each business. From April 2022, as Purpose being the 
ultimate definition of who we are as a Group and the introduction of the new logo, to maintain continuous growth over 
medium to long term for the aims under our Purpose, the new three-year Mid-term Plan has started.

<Bandai Namcoʼs Purpose> 
 
From April 2022, we have introduced a new logo that expresses the spirit of Purpose. All companies with “Bandai 
Namco” in their names will use this logo, and companies with and without “Bandai Namco” in their names will 
display this new Group logo on all their products and services, in principle. This will enable us to bring together the 
value of all our products, services, and labels under one logo and elevate the brand value of the Bandai Namco 
Group in the global market.

employees, and communities around the world. We will strive to connect more deeply with current fans and more 
broadly with new fans. In addition, we will aim to foster multifaceted connections among current fans and new fans 
as well as communities of fans. In fostering connections with and among various fans, our highest priority will be 
the quality of the connections. Under the Mid-term Plan, we will advance a variety of initiatives focusing on deep, 
broad, and multifaceted connections with fans and on the quality of those connections. 
 
3) Mid-term Vision

4) Main strategies and investment plan 
IP axis strategy 
The IP axis strategy, which is the Bandai Namco Groupʼs strength, is the core of the Mid-term Plan. We will aim 
for sustainable growth by implementing new initiatives to foster deep, broad, and multifaceted connections with 
fans around the world; by accelerating evolution in the IP axis strategy; and by working to build businesses as we 
work together under the ALL BANDAI NAMCO concept in regions around the world. 
· IP x Fans (connecting with fans through IP): New framework for connecting with fans 
Based on the IP axis, Bandai Namco will develop a metaverse for each IP as a new framework for connecting

of entertainment surrounding IP, as well as frameworks that leverage Bandai Namcoʼs distinctive strengths to fuse

connections with and among fans and business partners. Through the IP Metaverse, we will establish communities 
among Bandai Namco and fans, as well as among fans themselves. Through these communities and content, we 
will build deep, broad, multifaceted connections that continue for long periods of time, and we will focus on the 
quality of those connections. In this way, we will work to maximize IP value over the medium to long term.

We will leverage outlets for a wide range of products and services as well as our strengths in facilitating 
collaboration among physical and digital elements, and we will redefine the optimal IP axis strategy for IP fans 
and for IP itself. In these ways, we will aim to accelerate evolution in the IP axis strategy.

To work together and advance our strategies under the ALL BANDAI NAMCO concept in regions worldwide, we

Under this ALL BANDAI NAMCO concept, we work to build businesses in each region.

Over the three years of the Mid-term Plan, we will implement a total of 40.0 billion yen in strategic investment 
to accelerate evolution in the IP axis strategy. 
Strategic investment to maximize IP value: 25.0 billion yen

5) System for promotion of the Mid-term Plan 
· Strengthening the governance system of Bandai Namco Holdings 
In order to further increase corporate value by strengthening our corporate governance system and 
implementing rapid decision-making and business execution, we will transition to a company with an Audit & 
Supervisory Committee on the condition that the proposal for this transition is approved and adopted at the 
Seventeenth Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders to be held in June 2022. 
· Partial changes of the Unit structure 
From April 2022, we restructured the IP Production Unit and also integrated the Visual and Music Business and 
the Creation Business into the IP Production Business. In the IP Production Unit, Bandai Namco Filmworks Inc. 
will serve as a business management company upon having combined three companies that engage in the visual 
business within the IP Production Unit, namely SUNRISE INC., the visual business of Bandai Namco Arts Inc., and 
Bandai Namco Rights Marketing Inc.

----------------Page (9) Break----------------
- 7 - 
business around the world will further work as one under the ALL BANDAI NAMCO concept on the priority strategies, 
consisting of the IP axis strategy, Personnel strategy, and Sustainability, under the Mid-term Plan. 
In light of the implementation of these measures, the consolidated projections of the fiscal year ending March 31, 
2023 are as follows: net sales of 880,000 million yen (year-on-year decrease of 1.0%), operating profit of 100,000 million 
yen (year-on-year decrease of 20.3%), recurring profit of 101,000 million yen (year-on-year decrease of 24.4%), and profit 
attributable to owners of parent of 70,000 million yen (year-on-year decrease of 24.5%). 
 
(5) Basic Policy on the Distribution of Profits 
Bandai Namco Group ranks the return of profits to shareholders as one of its highest priorities in its management. 
The Group aims to further strengthen the Groupʼs competitiveness and, while maintaining a sound financial status, to 
achieve regular distributions of dividends and improvement in the Groupʼs corporate value. In embarking on the Mid-
term Plan, the Company has considered its basic policy on returning profits to shareholders from various perspectives, 
taking into account the Mid-term Planʼs main strategies and investment plan as well as the market environment. As a 
result, the Company decided to continue its basic policy of providing a return to shareholders that targets a total return 
ratio of 50% or more based on stable dividend payments of 2% of DOE (dividends on equity), maintaining long term and 
stable level of dividends and increasing the focus on the capital cost, with DOE and total return ratio as indicators. 
For the year-end dividend for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, based on this basic policy and the performance 
in the fiscal year, a performance-based dividend of 164 yen will be added to a base dividend of 24 yen, for a total of 188 
yen per share. Since the Company paid an interim dividend of 24 yen per share on December 7, 2021, the annual cash 
dividend will be 212 yen per share (total return ratio of 50.2%). The Companyʼs annual dividend forecast for the fiscal 
year ending March 31, 2023 is 54 yen per share, which is the base dividend set in accordance with the Companyʼs basic 
policy on the distribution of profits. The year-end cash dividend for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 will be 
considered by the Company based on the basic policy on the distribution of profits. 
 
2. Basic Concept Regarding Selection of Accounting Standards 
The Group plans to continue using Japanese GAAP to prepare its consolidated financial statements for the time being, 
as they facilitate comparison with previous consolidated financial statements and with other companies. 
The Groupʼs policy on applying International Financial Reporting Standards is to take action as appropriate based 
on considerations of various conditions in Japan and overseas.

(Changes in Accounting Policies) 
(Application of Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition, etc.) 
The Company has applied the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No. 29, March 31, 
2020; hereinafter the “Revenue Recognition Standard”) and other relevant ASBJ regulations from the beginning of the 
fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, and it has decided to recognize revenue at the time the control of promised goods or 
services is transferred to the customer at the amount expected to be received upon exchange of those goods or 
services. As a result of this application, revenue mainly for network content and home video games with online 
functions, which was previously recognized when items used in the content or video game software was sold, etc., will 
be recognized by calculating the estimated sales value for undelivered elements if there were elements that were not 
delivered to customers and recognizing an amount equivalent to that value as the revenue over the reasonably 
estimated period for which performance obligations are expected to be satisfied. 
The application of the Revenue Recognition Standard and other relevant ASBJ regulations is subject to the 
transitional treatment provided for in the proviso to paragraph 84 of the Revenue Recognition Standard. The 
cumulative effect of the retrospective application, assuming the new accounting policy had been applied to periods 
prior to the beginning of the current fiscal year was added to or deducted from the beginning balance of retained 
earnings of the current fiscal year, and thus the new accounting policy was applied from such beginning balance. 
However, applying the method provided for in paragraph 86 of the Revenue Recognition Standard, the new accounting 
policy was not retrospectively applied to contracts for which nearly all the revenue amounts had been recognized 
according to the previous treatment in periods prior to the beginning of the current fiscal year.  
“Trade receivables” under current assets of the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the previous fiscal year 
has been included in “Trade receivables and contract assets” from the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the 
current fiscal year. In addition, “Other current liabilities” under current liabilities has been included in “Contract 
liabilities” and “Other current liabilities” from the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the current fiscal year. 
However, in accordance with the transitional treatment provided for in paragraph 89-2 of the Accounting Standard for 
Revenue Recognition, figures for the previous fiscal year have not been restated in accordance with the new approach 
to presentation. 
As a result of this change, in comparison to the period before the application of the Revenue Recognition Standard, 
etc., for the current fiscal year, net sales increased by 83 million yen, cost of sales decreased by 1,903 million yen, and 
selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 2,416 million yen while operating profit, recurring profit and 
profit before income taxes each decreased by 429 million yen. 
Due to the reflection of the cumulative effects of changes to net assets at the beginning of the current fiscal year, 
the beginning balance of retained earnings in the consolidated statements of changes in net assets increased by 179 
million yen. 
The impact of this change on per-share data is described in the relevant section.

(Application of Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement, etc.) 
The Company has applied the “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Statement No. 30, July 4, 
2019; hereinafter the “Fair Value Measurement Standard”) and other relevant ASBJ regulations from the beginning of 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 and, in accordance with the transitional treatment provided for in paragraph 19 of 
the Fair Value Measurement Standard and paragraph 44-2 of the “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ 
Statement No. 10, July 4, 2019), the new accounting policy provided for in the Fair Value Measurement Standard and 
other relevant ASBJ regulations is applied prospectively. There is no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

(Segment Information) 
a. Segment Information 
1. Overview of reportable segments 
The reportable segments of the Company are components of the Group whose separate financial information is 
available and which are periodically evaluated by the Board of Directors in deciding how to allocate management 
resources and in assessing the performance. 
The Group is made up of (1) three Units, one for each business domain, namely the Entertainment Unit (Digital 
Business, Toys and Hobby Business), the IP Production Unit (Visual and Music Business, Creation Business), and 
the Amusement Unit, and (2) the affiliated business companies that mainly serve a supporting role for these Units. 
The business management company of each business leads the planning and promotion of the business strategies 
of the business for Japan and overseas. 
Accordingly, the Group has the following five reportable segments: Digital Business, Toys and Hobby Business, 
Visual and Music Business, Creation Business, and Amusement Business. 
The Digital Business conducts planning, development and distribution of network content, and planning, 
development and sales of home video games. The Toys and Hobby Business conducts planning, development, 
production and sales of toys, capsule toys, cards, confectionery and foods, apparel, sundries, plastic models, 
prizes, stationery, and other products. The Visual and Music Business conducts planning, production, and 
management of visual and music content, artist discovery and development, and live entertainment operations. 
The Creation Business conducts planning and production of animations, management and administration of 
copyrights and other rights, and production of music related to animations and management and administration 
of music and masters related to animations. The Amusement Business conducts planning, development, 
production and sales of amusement machines, and planning and operation of amusement facilities, etc. 
From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022, the Group reorganized its structure from its previous five Unit 
structure to a three Unit structure ahead of the start of the Mid-term Plan from April 2022. 
In conjunction with this organizational restructure, the reportable segments were changed from the Toys and 
Hobby Business, Network Entertainment Business, Real Entertainment Business, Visual and Music Production 
Business, and IP Creation Business to the Digital Business, Toys and Hobby Business, Visual and Music Business, 
Creation Business, and Amusement Business from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022. 
Segment information of the prior fiscal year is prepared and disclosed based on the reportable segment 
classifications after the change. 
 
2. Method for calculating the amounts of net sales, profit/loss, assets, liabilities and others by reportable 
segment 
Except for the accounting treatment for revenue recognition, the accounting method used for the business 
segments reported is the same as the accounting method stated in “Important Information Constituting the Basis 
for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements” presented in the most recent annual security report (filed 
on June 21, 2021). 
The profit of reportable segments is measured by operating profit. 
The inter-segment transactions are based on prevailing market prices.

(Application of Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition, etc.) 
As described in “(Changes in Accounting Policies),” the Company has applied the “Accounting Standard for 
Revenue Recognition” and other relevant ASBJ regulations from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 
2022, and changed the accounting treatment for revenue recognition. Accordingly, the Company has changed the 
method of measuring profit or loss of business segments. 
For the current fiscal year, as a result of this change, and compared with the figures obtained by the previous 
method, net sales decreased by 1,739 million yen and segment profit decreased by 422 million yen in the Digital 
Business; net sales increased by 2,289 million yen and segment profit decreased by 7 million yen, respectively, in 
the Toys and Hobby Business; net sales increased by 73 million yen in the Visual and Music Business; net sales

Business and Creation Business of the IP Production Unit by combining three companies in the visual business into 
one company and combining three companies in the music and live event businesses into one company. The

for IP through coordination among the visual, music and live event businesses. Furthermore, the Company 
aims to maximize the value of IP by coordinating with each Unit in the Group.
