# Nintendo Earnings Data and Other Video Game Companies

  # Description  

  I am Github user r134x7 also known as ggx2ac on Install Base Forum. This is an ever-evolving project that first started out years in Java (not in the repo) then moved to Python and is now a deployed front-end web app using React, Mantine, Vite and TypeScript. The deployed app contains a lot of earnings release data from various video game companies including Nintendo spanning many years.

# Background History:

I regularly make threads on video game forums for reporting Nintendo's financial earnings results that are reported quarterly. It gets very competitive posting threads on some forums because if you're not quick to post the thread first then someone else will be first and any duplicate threads will be locked. That was when I wanted to improve the quality of my threads that my work could stand out, first I went to learn the terms used for financial years because one common occurence was that thread titles did not contain the financial year for the quarter being reported. There would also be confusion when someone writes FY18 for example but that does not tell you when a company's financial year ends because it could refer to a fiscal year starting or ending in 2018. That's when I started posting the threads giving the month that a company's financial year ends for example, Nintendo FY3/2022 refers to Nintendo's financial year ending in March 2022 (All companies have financial years ending in different months). So when you think of a calendar year the calendar year for 2022 ends on 12/2022 and then the following month is the beginning of the calendar year ending in 12/2023. When I started doing this the effect was immediately obvious as other thread makers also tried putting in financial years in their thread titles for other video game companies although they didn't the exact syntax, instead they were putting the financial year in a range showing the beginning and end but not mention any month the fiancial year ends. It became obvious they wanted to do what I did but they didn't understand the syntax and they didn't want to make it look like they were copying me even though they could've asked me for help.

So around 2018 was when I felt the next step to improving my threads on Nintendo's earnings results was by using code to display the data. I was inspired by Chris1964 who posts Media Create sales threads weekly because the hardware data for Japan would be put in code output arranged in a table for ease of readability, I assume that the code output was actually from MySQL. I didn't ask for any help from him because I have had prior experience with programming from my University days. I taught myself how to code in Java from free online resources, I then bought an Android app that was a Java IDE. This is because I didn't have a computer so all the code was done on a smartphone using two thumbs. So from 2018 to 2021 I coded in Java to display Nintendo's financial data which would increase in size due to what gets reported. It's not just money that gets reported but sales data regarding units sold for Nintendo's hardware and software.

At the second half of 2021 the Java IDE app I was using no longer worked properly so I ended up finding a Python IDE Android app and started learning how to code in Python. It was a huge improvement because it reduced the amount of lines I used but it also let me tackle adding in new data. For those unaware, the data I post isn't a simple copy and paste. There is data in there in there you wouldn't find from what Nintendo posts such as quarterly data (not cumulative) and year-on-year data for hardware/software.

# Tests
  
  Tests written for:
  - KPI-Logic to get the output of the code to match that of the Python code other than getting the code to work.
  - Many other tests also in the __test__ folder but was only used to console.log which may not be considered proper. Due to utilising the Functional Programming paradigm my code is relatively robust.
